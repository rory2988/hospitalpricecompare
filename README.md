### User Stories Completed

* As a user I want to be able to sign in to a secure account so that I can keep my saved information private.
* As a user I want to be able to log out.
* As a new user I can sign up for the site, so that I can log in in the future and keep a saved list of favorite hospitals.
* As a user I want to be able to access my user welcome page, which has "Search hospitals" and "View favorites" options, from anywhere in the site, so that the key functions of the site are easily accessible.
* As a user I can search hospitals by state and procedure so that I can view hospitals that pertain to my situation.
* As a user I want to be able to look at my list of favorited hospitals so that I can keep track of hospitals I may go to.
* As a user I want to be able to delete hospitals from my favorites list so that I can pick and choose hospitals to save as favorites.
* As a user I want to be able to add hospitals to the favorites list so that I can save the names of hospitals that I might go to.
* As a user I can view the list of hospitals that offer my procedure by price so that I can easily choose the most affordable hospital.
* As a user I can make as many requests as I want so that I can do thorough research using the web app.  An API key will be necessary to allow this for many users.
* As a user I can choose my procedure from a drop-down menu so that I don't need to know the DRG code and so that I can choose the procedure closest in name to the one I need.
